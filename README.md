# Assignment-Data-Collection-and-Cleaning-for-Stock-Broker-Script-Master-Mapping

## Project Summary: 
Unified Mapping of Script Masters for Stock Brokers
## Objective: 
This project involves creating a singular mapping across five major stock brokers—Fyers, Angel One, ICICI, Kotak, and Zerodha—enabling a one-to-one correspondence for financial instruments between brokers.
The goal is to allow the selection of any instrument (such as stocks or derivatives) in one broker’s list to identify its equivalents across the other four brokers, facilitating streamlined cross-platform comparisons.

# Scope of Work:

### Data Collection and Preparation:

Gather the script master files from each of the five brokers, containing a complete list of instruments they trade (equities, derivatives, etc.). Each broker provides a public script master, which can be accessed without account requirements.
Ensure that all the relevant financial instruments (stocks, bonds, derivatives) are included to enable a comprehensive mapping.
Data Cleaning and Standardization:

Standardize the data by reconciling variations in naming conventions, codes (ISIN, NSE/BSE symbols), and classifications between brokers.
Handle discrepancies and redundancies within data fields, particularly focusing on instruments that may appear under different names or symbols across platforms.

### Mapping Creation:

Develop a unique mapping table to align each instrument across all five brokers. This mapping should allow users to select a script from one broker and retrieve its equivalent across the others.
Ensure that each script has an accurate mapping counterpart by cross-referencing identifiers such as ISIN codes, sector classifications, and ticker symbols.

### Testing and Validation:

Validate the mappings to confirm accurate cross-platform equivalency, ensuring the functionality supports seamless navigation from one broker’s instrument listing to another’s.

### Outcome and Utility:

This unified mapping will be particularly beneficial for traders and analysts who rely on data from multiple brokers, facilitating smoother comparisons and potentially improving trading efficiency by saving time in cross-referencing scripts.

### Potential Benefits:
This project promises to simplify trading and analysis across brokers, supporting efficient portfolio management, trading insights, and enhanced user experience for multi-broker users.
